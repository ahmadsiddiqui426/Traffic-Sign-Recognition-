Title: Traffic Sign Recognition using CNN and Machine Learning Techniques

Description:
Traffic Sign Recognition is a crucial component of modern transportation systems, enhancing road safety and enabling autonomous vehicles to navigate our roads effectively. This project leverages the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to create a robust and accurate system for recognizing and classifying traffic signs.

**Key Features:**

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** The project begins with the collection of a diverse dataset comprising various traffic signs. This dataset is preprocessed to ensure uniformity and remove noise, setting the stage for effective model training.

2. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):** A state-of-the-art CNN architecture is implemented to extract intricate features from traffic sign images. CNNs are well-suited for image classification tasks and have shown remarkable performance in recognizing patterns and shapes within images.

3. **Model Training:** The dataset is split into training, validation, and testing sets to train the CNN model. The model undergoes multiple iterations, fine-tuning, and optimization to achieve high accuracy and robustness in traffic sign recognition.

4. **Data Augmentation:** To improve model generalization, data augmentation techniques such as rotation, scaling, and mirroring are employed. This ensures that the model can recognize traffic signs under various real-world conditions.

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** The project involves experimenting with different hyperparameters, optimizing learning rates, batch sizes, and network architectures to achieve the best possible results.

6. **Evaluation Metrics:** Performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are computed to assess the model's effectiveness in recognizing traffic signs accurately and minimizing false positives.

7. **Real-Time Inference:** The trained model is deployed to perform real-time traffic sign recognition using live video feed from a camera. This showcases the practical application of the project for autonomous vehicles or advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS).

8. **Model Interpretability:** Techniques for interpreting the model's decisions are explored, allowing users to gain insights into how the CNN recognizes different traffic signs.
